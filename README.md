# Compunity

Compunity is a distributed computing platform, enabling multiple people to work on one project at the same time. At the core of our website we connect researchers to volunteers through a server. Researchers in need of more computing power are able to upload their computationally expensive C projects, after which it will be subdivided into jobs. Consequently, signed up volunteers can browse projects and contribute to a researcher's project bij executing jobs for the chosen project. After a project all jobs of a project are executed, the results can be downloaded by the researcher - easy as that. Our website aims to make executing large projects faster and more efficient.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies: `docker, docker-compose, npm`
2. Start the application: `bash start_dev.sh`

## Usage

The application database can be managed using "phpmyadmin". This service is accessible through a web-interface at port
